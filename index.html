<h1>Ghost</h1>
When Ghost was a child, his father got drunk and chased them with a gun, 
trying to shoot them to death. Ghost was invited to join the track and field 
team by the coach because of his extraordinary talent. After joining the track 
and field team, he had many conflicts with the team members. Ghost needed a pair 
of professional running shoes, but he was poor, so he stole the shoes. The coach 
found out but did not condemn... At the end of the story, Ghost added the first 
official competition. No one knows the result of the competition. It is an open ending.


After joining the track and field team, Ghost met the other key members of the team, 
including Lu, Patty, and Sunny. He had mixed feelings about Lu in particular: Lu had 
albinism, but performed confidently and perfectly, and was the best sprinter on the 
team. Ghost envied Lu's performance, but also felt inferior, thinking he couldn't compare to her.
During training, Ghost found that he had to abide by strict discipline and learn 
to control his emotions. Although he had a talent for running, his poor emotional 
management caused friction between him and his teammates and coaches. For example, 
he once became angry because he was dissatisfied with Lu's performance.


Before the game, the coach asked all the players to shave their heads to symbolize
team spirit and unity. Ghost was very resistant to this decision at first because 
hair is part of his identity. However, he eventually chose to shave his hair, which 
represented that he began to let go of the baggage of the past, accept the change, 
and integrate into the team.
